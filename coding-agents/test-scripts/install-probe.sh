# GAME=<path to a .sdd> targets a game other than SplinterFaction. It has to be an
# unpacked directory, not a .sdz, because this writes into it.
#
# The game copy is throwaway but has to end up unmodified, so both files live in
# the repo and this is the only thing that touches the game.
#
# The screenshot gadget goes in LuaRules rather than LuaUI on purpose. What most
# needs proving is the scene after "luaui disable", and only a gadget survives it.
#
# Both flags rewrite a constant in the installed copy rather than the source, and
# read the result back before returning. Three results in one session were
# mislabelled by patches that silently did not apply, so a substitution that
# cannot be seen to have worked is worse than no substitution.
