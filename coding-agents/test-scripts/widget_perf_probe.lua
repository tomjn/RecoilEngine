--
-- Copy or symlink into the throwaway game's LuaUI/Widgets/. install-probe.sh
-- does that, and keeps the source in the repo so it is not lost with the copy.
--
-- Why a widget rather than an engine change: Spring.GetProfilerRecordNames and
-- Spring.GetProfilerTimeRecord already expose every SCOPED_TIMER to Lua, and
-- "debug 1 0" turns the profiler on with its on-screen overlay off, so the whole
-- per-timer breakdown is reachable without touching the engine.
--
-- Why it freezes the scene: a live sim draws something different every run, and
-- differences between runs on this platform have already been large enough to
-- swamp what was being measured. Pausing at a fixed sim frame and re-applying
-- one camera state every frame makes the drawn scene the same from that point on,
-- for the whole run and between runs.

-- install-probe.sh --luaui-off <seconds> rewrites this line in the installed copy
-- and then reads it back, because os.getenv is stripped from the Lua sandbox at
-- LuaLibs.cpp:57 so the widget cannot be told at run time.
--
-- The disable removes the probe along with every other widget, which is the point:
-- it splits the game's cost into its 167 widgets against its gadgets, where the
-- unit materials live. Nothing re-enables it, so a run holds one switch and the
-- cycles either side of it are the two sides of the comparison.

-- between intervals and a live one varies by a factor of two, so a frame rate
-- taken in this mode means nothing. What it buys is a scene that a frozen one
-- cannot produce: a moving unit, command line and waypoint overlays, and line of
-- sight sweeping across new ground, which is where the engine's own world-space
-- drawing actually gets exercised.
--
-- It also removes a dependency on the faction. A locked camera frames whatever
-- the commander's start position happens to be, and different factions start
-- differently, so tracking is what makes two runs comparable by eye.

-- Tracking is engine state, like pause, so it survives "luaui disable" and the
